## Problem Statement -
 - Develop a robust and efficient data discovery tool capable of identifying
   and classifying Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within diverse data
   repositories, including relational databases, cloud storage services (e.g.,
   Google Cloud Storage,Amazon S3) and file systems. The tool should
   accurately determine the presence and type of PII in each data point and
   subsequently, assess the associated risk level forthe entire database or
   object.

## Our Solution -
 - We are developing an integrated platform that combines a blockchain-based e-vault for secure legal records and an AI-powered legal documentation assistant. The blockchain-powered e-vault ensures the utmost       security of legal documents, utilizing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for authentication and decentralized storage for tamper-proof records.
 - This guarantees data integrity and prevents unauthorized access, addressing the concerns about document security. Simultaneously, our AI-powered legal documentation assistant streamlines document management 
   by automating organization, employing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction, and generating multilingual summaries through machine learning.
 - We are also empowering users with smart contracts, granular access control, and a user-friendly interface, facilitating seamless integration with traditional legal systems. Our monetization strategies include 
   client-based compensation models, subscription plans, and a legal professional marketplace.
 - In summary, our project offers a comprehensive, innovative solution that addresses both security and accessibility challenges within the legal industry and we aim at modernizing legal document management.
